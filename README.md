# MCS Deconvolution

Includes a script with an implementation of the deconvolution based algorithm developed by Magain, Courbin and Sohy used to improve the resolution of images [1]. The script presents an approximative method and deviates from the paper in the minimisation section; for this reason, we recommend following the original work of the authors.
